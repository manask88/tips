This is an iOS (Swift) demo application to apply to CodePath
Time spent: 1 hours spent in tutorial, 8 hours developing all the required and one optional feature (time was also used refactoring code)

Completed user stories:

Required: Adding Tip Calculator Settings Page
Required: Creating a Settings View Controller
Required: Designing the Settings Page
Required: Loading and Saving
Required: View Controller Lifecycle

Optional: Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After an extended period of time, clear the state. This is a UI trick that Apple uses with the Spotlight app. If you return there a minute later, it will show your most recent search. if you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank. To implement this, plug into the application lifecycle and track time using NSDate

Notes:

I spent some time improving the design, similarly to the example given in the optional section. I spent some time refactoring the code to make it DRY. I used tuples. I used inheritance and created functions.

*LiceCap didn't work on my system. For that reason, I took screenshots of all the screees of my app.
